            Public cloud facilitates access to IT resources on a “pay as you go” billing model. 
            A service provider manages a public cloud solution’s core infrastructure, software 
            and other back-end architecture in a multitenant environment in order to free up the 
            customer from these responsibilities.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Choosing the right public cloud provider is becoming an increasingly nuanced discussion 
            that goes well beyond scale. There are three major players in the public cloud platforms arena – 
            Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft’s Azure, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, Linode and Rackspace Platform.
